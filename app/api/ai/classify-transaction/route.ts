Enabled Deduction Categories: ${categoriesList}

Australian Tax Deduction Categories:
1. Vehicles, Travel & Transport - Car expenses, fuel, parking, public transport, flights, accommodation
2. Work Tools, Equipment & Technology - Computers, software, tools, machinery, subscriptions
3. Work Clothing & Uniforms - Uniforms, protective clothing, safety equipment
4. Home Office Expenses - Utilities, internet, phone, office supplies, rent portion
5. Education & Training - Courses, conferences, books, professional development
6. Professional Memberships & Fees - Association fees, licenses, certifications
7. Meals & Entertainment (Work-Related) - Client meals, business entertainment, work functions
8. Personal Grooming & Wellbeing - Haircuts, gym memberships (if work-related)
9. Gifts & Donations - Corporate gifts, charitable donations, sponsorships
10. Investments, Insurance & Superannuation - Investment fees, insurance premiums, super contributions
11. Tax & Accounting Expenses - Accountant fees, tax preparation, bookkeeping

Rules:
- Only expenses (negative amounts) can be deductible
- Must be directly related to earning income or business activities
- Personal expenses are generally not deductible
- Consider Australian Tax Office (ATO) guidelines

Respond with EXACTLY one of these classifications:
- "AI possible deduction" - if this could reasonably be a tax-deductible business expense
- "AI non-deductible" - if this is clearly a personal expense or not deductible

Also provide:
- confidence: number from 0-100
- reasoning: brief explanation (max 50 words)
- category: which deduction category it fits (if deductible)

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "classification": "AI possible deduction" or "AI non-deductible",
  "confidence": number,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation",
  "category": "category name if deductible, null if not"
}`
